### What I've learned

ðŸ“– Upon building this web app I learned about:

- how to implement OAuth

- MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas

- sending data in query string from express when redirecting to Route in React-Router (or react component I should say)

- React context and used it with dealing with user authentication data (isLoggedIn)

- useEffect hook
